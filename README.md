## Description
This CLI program lets you generate an SVG Logo based on answers to prompts given through the command line! You're able to input up to 3 letters for your logo, add any color for the text, add any color for the background shape, and choose a circle, triangle, or square as the background shape. The program will take these inputs and create an svg file populated accordingly to those specifications.
